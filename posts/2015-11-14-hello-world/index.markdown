So this is where I'll be documenting my progress throughout the Season of KDE, as I had promised in my proposal. This will help me look back and improve on mistakes that I might have made earlier. I will post updates whenever I make any significant progress.

Please feel welcome to make suggestions, I'd love to know how I could do things better! Awesome things are (hopefully) coming!
