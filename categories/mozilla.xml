I'm going to be working on the Balrog update server this summer, under &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hearsum.ca"&gt;Ben's&lt;/a&gt; guidance. Thank you Mozilla and Google for giving me this chance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be optimizing Balrog by devising a mechanism to handle update races. A future blog post will describe how exactly these races occur and how I aim to resolve them. Basically, an algorithm similar to what git uses for 3-way merges is required, but we also need to take care of nesting since the 'Blob' data structure, that we use, has nested data. I will also share my proposal and the timeline I'll be following in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three months are going to be amazing and I'm really looking forward to working with the Mozilla RelEng community! I will be blogging weekly once the coding period commences, and I welcome any suggestions that might lead to me presenting a better final product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Mozilla</category><guid>http://nurav.github.io/posts/guess-who-got-into-google-summer-of-code/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2016 18:14:47 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
