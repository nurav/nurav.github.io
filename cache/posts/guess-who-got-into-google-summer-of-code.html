<p>I'm really excited to say that I'll be participating in Google Summer of Code this year, with Mozilla! I'm going to be working on the Balrog update server this summer, under <a class="reference external" href="http://hearsum.ca">Ben's</a> guidance. Thank you Mozilla and Google for giving me this chance!</p>
<p>I'll be optimizing Balrog by devising a mechanism to handle update races. A future blog post will describe how exactly these races occur and how I aim to resolve them. Basically, an algorithm similar to what git uses for 3-way merges is required, but we also need to take care of nesting since the 'Blob' data structure, that we use, has nested data. I will also share my proposal and the timeline I'll be following in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>These three months are going to be amazing and I'm really looking forward to working with the Mozilla RelEng community! I will be blogging weekly once the coding period commences, and I welcome any suggestions that might lead to me presenting a better final product.</p>
